/**
* Submodule: javatypes
*
* this module contains the C++ projection of Java types
*    such as pair from apache, NativeOperationException
*
* it contains the high-level object tag of jni.hpp
*    and related low-level functions to ease its usage
*
* Note: due to the bad design of jni.hpp to compose and wrap objects
*     we had to write "class-wrappers" in a odd way instead of provding a clean wrapper
