/**
 * @mainpage WBCrypto source code documentation
 *
 * This documentation describes the internal structure of Wbcrypto.  It was
 * automatically generated from specially formatted comment blocks in
 * mbed TLS's source code using Doxygen.  (See
 * http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ for more information on Doxygen)
 *
 * @section mainpage_modules Modules
 *
 * Wbcrypto contains the following functionality, organized into individual modules:
 *      * Fast Matrix Generation & Manipulation (wbmatrix.h)
 *      * SM3 Algorithm                         (sm3.h)
 *      * SM4 Algorithm                         (sm4.h)
 *      * White Box SM4 Algorithm               (wbsm4.h)
 *      * White Box SM4 table generate Algorithm(wbsm4_generator.h)
 *      * SM2 Algorithm                         (sm2.h)
 *      * White Box SM2 Algorithm               (wbsm2.h)
 *      * Cooperative SM2 Algorithm             (sm2coop.h)
 *      * Cooperative RSA Algorithm             (rsacoop.h)
 *      * Key Box Storage Service               (keybox_wbsm2.h, etc......)
 *
 * they all have their own header file, refer to them for further API details and refer to their individual Examples for usage
